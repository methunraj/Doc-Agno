Engineers and researchers use Agno to build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:

- **Level 1:** Agents with tools and instructions ([example](/introduction/agents#level-1%3A-agents-with-tools-and-instructions)).
- **Level 2:** Agents with knowledge and storage ([example](/introduction/agents#level-2%3A-agents-with-knowledge-and-storage)).
- **Level 3:** Agents with memory and reasoning ([example](/introduction/agents#level-3%3A-agents-with-memory-and-reasoning)).
- **Level 4:** Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate ([example](/introduction/multi-agent-systems#level-4%3A-agent-teams-that-can-reason-and-collaborate)).
- **Level 5:** Agentic Workflows with state and determinism ([example](/introduction/multi-agent-systems#level-5%3A-agentic-workflows-with-state-and-determinism)).

**Example:** Level 1 Reasoning Agent that uses the YFinance API to answer questions:

```python Reasoning Finance Agent
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables to display data.",
    markdown=True,
)
```

# Getting Started

If you're new to Agno, learn how to build your [first Agent](/introduction/agents), chat with it on the [playground](/introduction/playground) and [monitor](/introduction/monitoring) it on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

# Why Agno?

Agno will help you build best-in-class, highly-performant agentic systems, saving you hours of research and boilerplate. Here are some key features that set Agno apart:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Highly performant**: Agents instantiate in **~3Î¼s** and use **~6.5Kib** memory on average.
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Reasoning improves reliability and is a must-have for complex autonomous agents. Agno supports 3 approaches to reasoning: Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
- **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they accept text, image, audio and video as input and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with reasoning, memory, and shared context.
- **Built-in Agentic Search**: Agents can search for information at runtime using 20+ vector databases. Agno provides state-of-the-art Agentic RAG, **fully async and highly performant.**
- **Built-in Memory & Session Storage**: Agents come with built-in `Storage` & `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: After building your Agents, serve them using pre-built FastAPI routes. 0 to production in minutes.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
