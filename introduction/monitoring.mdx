# Agent Monitoring

You can track your Agent in real-time on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Authenticate

Get your API key from the [settings page](https://app.agno.com/settings) and set the `AGNO_API_KEY` env var.

```bash
export AGNO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Enable Monitoring

Enable monitoring for a single agent or globally for all agents by setting `AGNO_MONITOR=true`.

### For a Specific Agent

```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

### Globally for all Agents

```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

## Debug Logs

Want to see the system prompt, user messages and tool calls?

Agno includes a built-in debugger that will print debug logs in the terminal. Set `debug_mode=True` on any agent or set `AGNO_DEBUG=true` in your environment.

```python debug_logs.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data. Don't include any other text.",
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,
)
agent.print_response("What is the stock price of Apple?", stream=True)
```

Run the agent to view debug logs in the terminal:

```shell
python debug_logs.py
```

<video

   className="w-full aspect-video"
   style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }}
   src="/videos/debug_logs.mp4"
></video>

## Agent Registry

Agents, Teams and Workflows are collectively referred to as "Components of your Agentic System". When you run them with monitoring enabled, they are registered with the Agno Platform. This means you can view their metadata, runs and configuration.

The Registry acts as a unified dashboard where all your Agno Agents, Teams, Workflows and Apps are displayed, giving you full visibility into your operational environment.

Start exploring your Agents, Teams and Workflows at [app.agno.com/registry](https://app.agno.com/registry).
