title: Running your Agent
description: Learn how to run an agent and get the response.
---

The `Agent.run()` function runs the agent and generates a response, either as a `RunResponse` object or a stream of `RunResponse` objects.

Many of our examples use `agent.print_response()` which is a helper utility to print the response in the terminal. It uses `agent.run()` under the hood.

## Running your Agent

Here's how to run your agent. The response is captured in the `response`.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunResponse = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")

# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

## RunResponse

The `Agent.run()` function returns a `RunResponse` object when not streaming. It has the following attributes:

Understanding Metrics

For a detailed explanation of how metrics are collected and used, please refer to the [Metrics Documentation](/agents/metrics).

See detailed documentation in the [RunResponse](/reference/agents/run-response) documentation.

## Streaming Responses

To enable streaming, set `stream=True` when calling `run()`. This will return an iterator of `RunResponseEvent` objects instead of a single response.

<Note>
From `agno` version `1.6.0`, the `Agent.run()` function returns an iterator of `RunResponseEvent`, not of `RunResponse` objects.
</Note>

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponseEvent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponseEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True
)

# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True)
```

### Streaming Intermediate Steps

For even more detailed streaming, you can enable intermediate steps by setting `stream_intermediate_steps=True`. This will provide real-time updates about the agent's internal processes.

```python
# Stream with intermediate steps
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponseEvent] = agent.run(
    "Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion",
    stream=True,
    stream_intermediate_steps=True
)
```

### Handling Events

You can process events as they arrive by iterating over the response stream:

```python
response_stream = agent.run("Your prompt", stream=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)

for event in response_stream:
    if event.event == "RunResponseContent":
        print(f"Content: {event.content}")
    elif event.event == "ToolCallStarted":
        print(f"Tool call started: {event.tool}")
    elif event.event == "ReasoningStep":
        print(f"Reasoning step: {event.content}")
    ...
```

You can see this behavior in action in our [Playground](https://app.agno.com/playground/agents?endpoint=demo.agnoagents.com&agent=reasoning-agent).

### Event Types

The following events are yielded by the `Agent.run()` and `Agent.arun()` functions depending on the agent's configuration:

#### Core Events
| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RunStarted` | Indicates the start of a run |
| `RunResponseContent` | Contains the model's response text as individual chunks |
| `RunCompleted` | Signals successful completion of the run |
| `RunError` | Indicates an error occurred during the run |
| `RunCancelled` | Signals that the run was cancelled |

#### Control Flow Events
| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RunPaused` | Indicates the run has been paused |
| `RunContinued` | Signals that a paused run has been continued |

#### Tool Events
| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ToolCallStarted` | Indicates the start of a tool call |
| `ToolCallCompleted` | Signals completion of a tool call, including tool call results |

#### Reasoning Events
| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `ReasoningStarted` | Indicates the start of the agent's reasoning process |
| `ReasoningStep` | Contains a single step in the reasoning process |
| `ReasoningCompleted` | Signals completion of the reasoning process |

#### Memory Events
| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `MemoryUpdateStarted` | Indicates that the agent is updating its memory |
| `MemoryUpdateCompleted` | Signals completion of a memory update |

See detailed documentation in the [RunResponseEvent](/reference/agents/run-response) documentation.
